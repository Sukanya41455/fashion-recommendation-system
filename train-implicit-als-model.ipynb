It's a matrix factorization method based on SVD (it's actually an approximated, numerical version of SVD). Basically, ALS factorizes the interaction matrix (user x items) into two smaller matrices, one for item embeddings and one for user embeddings. These new matrices are built in a manner such that the multiplication of a user and an item gives (approximately) it's interaction score. This build embeddings for items and for users that live in the same vector space, allowing the implementation of recommendations as simple cosine distances between users and items. This is, the 12 items we recommend for a given user are the 12 items with their embedding vectors closer to the user embedding vector.\n","\n","There are a lot of online resources explaining it.
